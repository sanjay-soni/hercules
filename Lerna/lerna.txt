Lerna - Tool for javascript monorepos

Solves three biggest problems 
- links different projects within the repo (bootstrap)
- runs command against multiple repo
- manages publish process

Commands 
- bootstrap
- version (increment version)
- publish (tag and publish packages)


Bootstrap
- links different projects within the repo so they can import each other without having to publish anything to NPM.

** Running lerna bootstrap will invoke npm install in each of the packages, and will link local package such that the resulting structure will look like this.
** By default, Lerna is going to run npm install in every directory which results in node modules duplication. You can dedupe the packages by passing --hoist.
- lerna bootstrap --hoist
